# Deploying to Vercel - Troubleshooting Guide

## Source Code Displayed Instead of Rendered App

If your Vercel deployment is showing the source code instead of the rendered application, follow these steps:

1. **Check Build Configuration**:
   - Make sure you're using the correct build command: `node vercel-build.js`
   - Verify the output directory is set to `dist`

2. **Verify Files**:
   - Ensure `vercel-build.js` exists in your repository
   - Check that `vercel.json` has the correct rewrites and configuration

3. **Setup Rewrites in vercel.json**:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "buildCommand": "node vercel-build.js",
     "outputDirectory": "dist",
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "/api" },
       { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Examine Build Logs**:
   - Look for any errors during the build process
   - Make sure both the client and server builds complete successfully

5. **Manual Fix**:
   - After updating configuration, trigger a new deployment
   - You may need to clear Vercel's cache before deploying again
